"""
The following program is a simple password generator which asks the user the amount of letters, symbmols and numbers they want in their generated password.
The first part of the code generates the password but in the order or letters being first, symbols being second and lastly numbers at the end of the password.
The second part however completely randomizes the entire password regardless of the type of character.

Can use one more method shuffle() to shuffle the password, but the password should be in the list data type format.
To convert that list to string, one can just simply use for loop adding each characted to an empty string declared before the loop.

That is passed through the choice funtciont where it will randomly pick out the character from that SPECIFIED LIST which was randomly generated by generating 0, 1 or 2 numbers using randint() function just before.
