"""Following is a simple implementation of if and else statements. Using that knowledge, a simple game has been created where the story moves based on the decision which the individual makes at any point in the story.
Keeping the simplicity in mind, any one decision will lead to 'Game Over' and rest of the decisions will make the story go forward.
